				Pi3C is a fast, C++ graphics engine and toolkit tailored for all models of the Raspberry Pi and works on other platforms
				such as Windows. It's small size and innovative techniques make it fast enough to run highly detailed 3D games; even
				on the Pi Zero.
				</p><br>
				<p>
				Pi3C is designed to be simple to use and encourage youngsters (or anyone) new to programming by exploring the basic tutorials, games and apps provided.<br><br>

				These range from a few lines of simple, self explained code to more complex, real-world and heavy-weight examples.<br><br>

				Pi3C tries to avoid the complexities of C++ by providing a top-level class called Pi3C. This class has simple commands to help you start your journey into the exciting world of C++ <br>programming. Pi3C's utilizes the 'Simple DirectMedia Layer' (SDL 2.0) cross-platform development library (<a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.libsdl.org">https://www.libsdl.org/</a>).<br><br>

				Pi3C provides functions to render Open GLES 2.0 graphics using shaders. It also provides a high speed, Immediate Mode Graphics User Interface (IMGUI) with various buttons, text and common <br>widgets. Using these functions, complex Apps and games can be made with relative ease.<br><br>

				Pi3C will also includes tools for 3D modelling and scene arrangemet with 1st person capabilites for testing scenes such as free flight, point and jump, and full screen renderng. Other <br>tools planned will include an IMGUI interface designer and C++ code generator that will jump-start your project.<br>

				Pi3C is currently under heavy development and functions may/will change over time as new Apps, Games and Demos are developed. These developments will continue to greatly improve, enhance <br>and simplify the Pi3C graphics engine and speed up your coding.<br><br>

				I hope that you will enjoy your experience with Pi3C as it develops!<br><br>
